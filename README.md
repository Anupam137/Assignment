# Assignment
In this Project I created a flask based application that fetches data from a paginated API, identifies citations in the responses, and returns the citations in a JSON format.


**STEPS:

Step1: Clone the Repository - git clone <repository-url>.

Step2: Create a virtual environment (not necessary but its better to keep different projects in different environments with their dedicated libraries installed)

Step3: Install Dependencies -> (I have added the depedencies in requirements file so you can install them directly using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Step4: Run the Flask Application -> (command - python app.py)

Step5 : Access the API ->
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_citations

Result: This endpoint will return the citations in JSON format.
